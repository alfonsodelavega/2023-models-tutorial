# Introduction

## Outline

1. Exercises with the [Epsilon Playground](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/live/):
   * EOL: the base expression language
   * ETL: transform a model to another model
   * EGL: generate text from a model
2. Contest along the exercises!
3. Epsilon integration with existing codebases

## What is Model-Driven Engineering?

* In "traditional" engineering, we develop the system directly on the implementation language
* Model-driven engineering (MDE) uses instead *modeling languages* specific to the problem
* A railway engineer cares about railways: the actual implementation will come later!

<small>[This JOT blog post](http://blog.jot.fm/2013/01/25/lies-damned-lies-and-uml2java/) talks about what MDE is *not*, too!</small>

- We are developing a *system* <small>(e.g. a railway control system)</small>
- The *model* describes a part of it <small>(e.g. the tracks, sensors, and actuators)</small>
- A *modeling language* is used to specify the model<br/><small>(e.g. [railML](https://www.railml.org/en/))</small>
- A *modeling language* has:
  - *Abstract syntax*: concepts
  - *Concrete syntax*: notation (graphical, textual, tabular...)

- To reduce the cost of making a modeling language, we often use a *metamodeling language* <small>(e.g. [Ecore from EMF](https://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/), or [XML Schema](https://www.w3.org/XML/Schema))</small>
- We create a *metamodel* of the concepts of the language, which drives its implementation <small>(e.g. an <code>.ecore</code> or <code>.xsd</code> file)</small>
- We use other tools (e.g. [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/) or [Xtext](https://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/)) to implement the concrete syntax (notation)

## Some examples of modeling languages

* [Archimate](https://publications.opengroup.org/archimate-library/archimate-standards/c197): for enterprise architectures
* [BPMN](https://www.bpmn.org/): for business processes
* [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html): for control systems
* [SysML](https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/): for systems engineering
* [ThingML](https://github.com/TelluIoT/ThingML): for Internet-of-Things devices
* [UML](https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/): for software development

## Where does Epsilon come into play?

* A model is more than just documentation:
  * We can do early validation on the model
  * We can transform the model to another language
  * We can produce reports and code from it
* [Eclipse Epsilon](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/) provides a family of languages dedicated to model-to-model transformation, code generation, model validation, and other common MDE tasks

## How can Eclipse Epsilon be used?

* We will use the [Playground](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/live) to learn the basics
* The [Eclipse-based editors](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/download/) are best for rapid development of Epsilon scripts
* Epsilon scripts can be embedded into:
  * Your own Eclipse plugins
  * Your JVM-based programs (using plain JAR distributions from [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:org.eclipse.epsilon))
  * Your [Ant](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/workflow/)/[Maven](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/articles/running-epsilon-ant-tasks-from-command-line/#maven)/[Gradle](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/articles/running-epsilon-ant-tasks-from-command-line/#gradle) build processes

# Hands-on exercises: Epsilon Object Language (EOL)

## First steps

* We'll start with EOL, the base for all other Epsilon languages: it provides imperative code blocks, modularity, and expressions
* Please open the [Epsilon Playground](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/live){target="_blank"}
* Select the "Query Project Plan" example project

:::
::: {.column width="70%" align=center}

* Playground uses [Emfatic](https://www.eclipse.org/emfatic/) as concrete syntax for metamodels
* Metamodel describes a task tracking domain-specific modeling language (DSML):
  * Projects have title + description, contain 0+ tasks and people
  * Tasks have title + start + duration, contain effort assignments
  * People have names
  * An effort assignment has percentage, refers to a person

:::
::::::::::::::

## Model for sample EOL project

![](img/flexmi-model.png)

* Playground uses "fuzzy" [Flexmi XML](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/flexmi/) for models
* Alice and Bob work across 3 tasks (analysis, design, and implementation)

## First bit of EOL code!

* Replace the "Program" with this, and click on ![](img/eol-run.png){style="margin: 0px;"}:

   ```eol
   Task.all.first.title.println();
   ```

* `Type.all` = collection of all `Type` instances
* All collections support [a number of operations](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/eol/#collections-and-maps): `first` returns the first element
* `println()` is one operation supported by [any value](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/eol/#types): you can also provide a string as a prefix (e.g. `"title: "`)

## Looping with for

* A "foreach" loop in EOL is done as follows:
  ```eol
  for (element in collection) {
    /* code */
  }
  ```
* Change the code to print the title of all tasks

::: notes

```eol
for (t in Task.all) {
  t.title.println('title: ');
}
```

:::

## First-order operations

* Show only the tasks longer than 3 days
* Two approaches:
  * `if` inside the `for` loop (as in C / JavaScript)
  * Use `collection.select(e | condition)`
* EOL collections have other useful ["first-order operations"](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/eol/#collections-and-maps) like `select`, replacing many loops:
  * Closures, key-value mappings, first match
  * Universal/existential quantifiers
  * Sorting by expression, etc.

::: notes

```eol
for (t in Task.all.select(e | e.duration > 3)) {
  t.title.println('title: ');
}
```

:::

## Context operations

* Let's refactor the idea of "large task" to a *context operation*: place it at the end of "Program".
  ```eol
  operation Task isLarge(threshold) {
    return self.duration > threshold;
  }
  ```
* Now you can do `t.isLarge(3)` if `t` is a `Task`
* It's useful to create a library of operations for your DSML, which you can reuse from any Epsilon script by using the `import` statement.

::: notes

```eol
for (t in Task.all.select(e | e.isLarge(3))) {
  t.title.println('title: ');
}

operation Task isLarge(threshold) {
  return self.duration > threshold;
}
```

:::

## In-place transformations

* EOL is often used for small imperative in-place model transformations
* For instance, if we want to add a new person:
  ```eol
  var p = new Person;
  p.name = "Charlie";
  Project.all.first.people.add(p);
  ```
* Try adding a "Testing" task taking 4 days before your `for` loop: it should appear in the output

::: notes

```eol
var t = new Task;
t.title = "Testing";
t.duration = 4;
Project.all.first.tasks.add(t);

for (t in Task.all.select(e | e.isLarge(3))) {
  t.title.println('title: ');
}

operation Task isLarge(threshold) {
  return self.duration > threshold;
}
```

## First steps with ETL

* We will work on transforming a tree model into a graph model, step by step.
* Open the "Transform Tree to Graph" sample project in the Playground.

## Playground UI for sample ETL project

![](img/playground-ui-etl.png){ width=90% }

## Creating our first rule

* Replace the contents of "Transformation" with this, and click on ![](img/eol-run.png){style="margin: 0px;"}:

```etl
rule Tree2Graph
  transform t: Source!Tree
  to g: Target!Graph {

}
```

* `Source!Tree`: `Tree` type in source metamodel
* `Target!Graph`: `Graph` type in target metamodel
* We get four `Graph`s (one per `Tree`)

## Adding a guard

* We only want the `Graph` from the root `Tree`
* We can set a condition as a *guard* for the rule

```etl
rule Tree2Graph
  transform t: Source!Tree
  to g: Target!Graph {
  guard: t.parent.isUndefined()
}
```

* Alternatively, the guard can be a block of EOL code returning a Boolean value

## Adding the name

* Besides a guard, the body of a rule can have arbitrary EOL code: loops, variables, etc.
* Can you set the name of the `Graph` to the label of the `Tree`?

. . .

```etl
rule Tree2Graph
  transform t: Source!Tree
  to g: Target!Graph {
  guard: t.parent.isUndefined()
  g.name = t.label;
}
```

## Mapping trees to nodes

* Try adding a rule that:
  * Produces `Node`s from `Tree`s which have a parent
  * Sets the `name` of the `Node` to the `label` of the `Tree`

. . .

The rule would look like this:

```etl
rule Tree2Node
  transform t: Source!Tree
  to n: Target!Node {
  guard: t.parent.isDefined()
  n.name = t.label;
}
```

## Adding the nodes to the Graph

* Extend `Tree2Node` to add the new `Node` to the `nodes` of the `Graph`:
  1. Fetch the only `Target!Graph`
  1. Access its `nodes`
  1. `add()` the `Node`

. . .

```etl
rule Tree2Node
  transform t: Source!Tree
  to n: Target!Node {
  n.name = t.label;
  Target!Graph.all.first.nodes.add(n);
}
```

::: notes

Tree2Node can be placed anywhere in the ETL script, because in the absence of any lazy rules, ETL uses a "fast" transformation strategy where all the target elements are created first (while checking guards), and *then* the bodies of the rules are run.

:::

## Adding child edges with equivalent()

* Next, we want to link the new `Node` to all its children: this requires knowing the `Node`s that were produced from the child `Tree`s
* ETL has the `t.equivalent()` operation for this: called on a `Tree t`, it will return the first element produced from it

Try extending the `Tree2Node` rule to do this.

## Adding parent edges: extended rule

```etl
rule Tree2Node
  transform t: Source!Tree
  to n: Target!Node {
  guard: t.parent.isDefined()
  n.name = t.label;

  var g = Target!Graph.all.first;
  g.nodes.add(n);

  for (c in t.children) {
    var e = new Target!Edge;
    e.source = n;
    e.target = c.equivalent();

    g.edges.add(e);
  }
}
```

## There is more to ETL!

We haven't touched on quite a few things:

* Rule scheduling: `@primary` / `@lazy` / `@greedy`
* Rule inheritance and overriding
* The `::=` operator
* Persistence and use of transformation traces

# Walkthrough: Epsilon Generation Language (EGL)

## What is EGL for?

* EGL implements model-to-text transformations: we can produce code, reports, images (e.g. using [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)) from a model
* EGL is a templating language, in the style of [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/), [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), or raw PHP
* The Playground visualisations and the [Picto tool](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/picto/) are based on EGL

## Demo time in the Playground

Let's take a look at "Generate Effort Table":

![](img/playground-ui-egl.png){ width=80% }

## Other EGL features

* Protected regions, which can be customized by developers and kept across regenerations
* Formatters, i.e. for automatically indenting code according to style guidelines
* Coordination through the [EGX](https://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/egx/) language, for producing multiple files

# Epsilon Integration with existing codebases (TBD)

# Conclusions

## Thank you!
